    <h1>Hello Nature</h1>
    <p class="div1">
        Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nature is made of everything we see around us –trees, flowers, plants, animals, sky, mountains, forests and more. 
        Human beings depend on nature to stay alive. 
        Nature helps us breathe, gives us food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothes. 
        We find many colors in nature which make the Earth beautiful.
        Animals, fish and insects also get their food and shelter from nature. 
        Different trees grow up due to sunlight and water provided by nature. 
        Humans should stop causing harm to the elements of nature for their needs. 
        Nature is very important to maintain the growth and balance of life on earth.
    </p>

    <p id="div2">
        Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. 
        "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. 
        The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. 
        Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena
